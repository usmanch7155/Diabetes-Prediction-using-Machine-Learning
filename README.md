# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic data. The system is developed using Python and implemented with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

The dataset used in this project (diabetes.csv) contains medical attributes such as:

Number of Pregnancies

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin Level

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

The target variable indicates whether the person is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive system that can assist in early detection of diabetes using Machine Learning techniques. Early prediction can help in preventive care and better health management.

⚙️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Loaded the dataset using Pandas and analyzed its structure.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values

Separated features (X) and target (Y)

Standardized the data

Split into training and testing sets

3️⃣ Model Training

Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for training the model.

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using accuracy score to measure how well the model predicts unseen data.

5️⃣ Predictive System

Built a system where user input medical values can be given, and the model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not.

🚀 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

Supervised Learning

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Medical Data Analysis

Model Evaluation Techniques

Building Real-world ML Applications

This project is an important step toward applying Machine Learning in healthcare and predictive analytics.
